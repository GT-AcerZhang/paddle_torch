# paddorch

## Introduction
PaddlePaddle is the DL framework developped by Baidu, and this library is aim to provide 
a PaddlePaddle wrapper for the common pytorch interface, so people can try out paddlepaddle on their
pytorch code without much change.


## install
`pip install .`


## Examples

I used this library to reimplement below projects

 1. [BigGAN: Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis](https://github.com/zzz2010/BigGAN-paddle)
 2. [StarGAN v2: Diverse Image Synthesis for Multiple Domains](https://github.com/zzz2010/starganv2_paddle)
 3. [Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation](https://github.com/zzz2010/ugatit-paddle2)
